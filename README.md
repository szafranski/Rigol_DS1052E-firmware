# Rigol_DS1052E-firmware
Firmware and 100MHz mod for a Rigol scope.

NO (RISKY) SERIAL NUMBER CHANGING! Just put USB drive into the scope! 

Checked on my scope. Worked. 

I firstly updated some old firmware to the newest one (04.02 from about 2016) - non-moded
and than flashed firmware once again with that firmware but moded. 

DO IT AT YOU OWN RISK - it is minimal but still

This repository is more like a "helping hand".
